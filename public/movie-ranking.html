<h1>The Best Movies According to KoalaPola</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Matilda</h3>
<p>This is my childhood favorite movie of all time, fun and magical.</p>
<h3>2. Harry Potter - all of them</h3>
<p>All 90's kids know who Harry Potter is because we grew up together in their magical world.<br/>
    Love how the character progresses througout the movie series, how we felt joy, experience pain, cried with them and feel their victories.<br/>  
</p>
<h3>3. Mission Impossible</h3>
<p>Love me some Tom Cruise movie.<br/> 
    I might say I like the most recent movies of the series, Dead Reckoning Part 1 is most thrilling and leaving just enough hanging to make you excited about what's next.<br/>
